here 400 NVMe is attached to the EC2 instance.

The **c5d.4xlarge** instance type in Amazon EC2 is part of the **C5 instance family**, which is optimized for compute-intensive workloads. The "d" in **c5d** indicates that the instance comes with **NVMe-based SSD instance storage** (also called **ephemeral storage** or **local storage**). Let’s break down what this means:

### **Key Features of c5d.4xlarge**

1. **Instance Storage**:
    
    - The **c5d.4xlarge** instance comes with **400 GB of NVMe SSD storage** directly attached to the physical host machine.
        
    - This storage is **local to the instance**, meaning it is physically connected to the server hosting your EC2 instance.
        
2. **Temporary (Ephemeral) Storage**:
    
    - The NVMe storage is **ephemeral**, which means:
        
        - Data stored on this storage is **not persistent**.
            
        - If the instance is **stopped**, **terminated**, or **fails**, the data on the local storage is **lost**.
            
        - This storage is ideal for temporary data, such as caches, buffers, or scratch data.
            
3. **Performance**:
    
    - NVMe SSDs provide **extremely high performance** with low latency and high IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second).
        
    - This makes the local storage suitable for workloads that require fast access to temporary data, such as big data processing, high-performance computing (HPC), or temporary databases.

### **When to Use c5d.4xlarge with NVMe Storage**

- **Temporary Data**: Use the local storage for data that doesn’t need to persist beyond the lifecycle of the instance (e.g., temporary files, caches, or scratch data).
    
- **High-Performance Workloads**: Ideal for workloads that require very fast storage access, such as:
    
    - Data processing (e.g., Hadoop, Spark).
        
    - High-frequency trading.
        
    - Video encoding or rendering.
        
    - Scientific simulations.
        
- **Cost-Effective**: Since the NVMe storage is included in the instance cost, it can be more cost-effective than using additional EBS volumes for temporary storage.

### **What Happens to the Data on NVMe Storage?**

- **Instance Stop**: If you **stop** the instance, the data on the NVMe storage is **lost**. When you restart the instance, the storage is wiped clean.
    
- **Instance Termination**: If you **terminate** the instance, the data on the NVMe storage is **permanently lost**.
    
- **Instance Failure**: If the underlying hardware fails, the data on the NVMe storage is **lost**.

### **How to Make Data Persistent**

If you need to store data permanently, you should use **persistent storage options** like:

4. **Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)**:
    
    - Provides persistent block storage volumes that can be attached to your EC2 instance.
        
    - Data on EBS volumes persists even if the instance is stopped or terminated (unless you delete the volume).
        
5. **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**:
    
    - Object storage for backups, archives, and large-scale data storage.
        
    - Accessible from anywhere, not tied to a specific instance.
        
6. **Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)**:
    
    - A scalable file storage service that can be mounted to multiple EC2 instances simultaneously.

### **Summary**

- The **400 GB NVMe storage** on the **c5d.4xlarge** instance is **local and ephemeral**.
    
- It is **not persistent** and is wiped clean if the instance is stopped, terminated, or fails.
    
- Use this storage for temporary, high-performance workloads.
    
- For persistent data, use **EBS**, **S3**, or **EFS**.
    

If you need both high-performance local storage and persistent storage, you can combine the NVMe storage with an EBS volume or other persistent storage solutions.
