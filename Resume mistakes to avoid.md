Only 2% of candidates make it to the interview stage.

Mistake 1: Place experience before education.

Recruiters only scan your resume for 6-8 seconds, if they don't see relevant experience immediately, they will move on to the next candidate.

Highlight job and experience that match the job you're applying for

Mistake 2: Adding job responsibilities but no achievement

Recruiters spend 65% of time on work experience.

Add numbers in cv to create impact.

Mistake 3: Using chronological order instead of relevance.

Recruiters don't need to know everything you have done.

To prevent your best qualification from getting missed. Write it early on what make you a strong fit for that job.

Mistake 4: Failing to tailor the resume.

Sending the same resume to every job is like trying to use one key for every lock.

Every job description has specific keywords that your the recruiter and ats are looking for. Use these keywords in your resume so that it doesn't get filtered out.

Spend some time customizing the resume for each job. Look for important keyword in jd and add them to your resume.

Mistake 5: Don't ignore the small things in your resume

Professional email address

Grammar and spelling error

Same font

A resume that's too long may lose recruiterâ€™s attention

Think from the recruiter's perspective.. why should I hire him
